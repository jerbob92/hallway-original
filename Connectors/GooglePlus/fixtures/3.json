Sorry for the translation. But thanks for Google Translate the text in English.\n I&#39;m funky-businessman. My name Symbol Sun. And I am search for investors to my program &quot;White Eyes&quot;.\n I wrote the script four months of the innovation program &quot;White Eyes&quot;. Now the buyer is able to create a game in two meta-genres: \n1) Run Games (Action, Quest, etc.) \n2) Strategy Games (RTS, Global strategy, etc.) \nForget about the past of such programs. &quot;White Eyes&quot; turn the computer industry. One person will be able to create a game for half an hour! This is a revolution! This is innovation! \n\nThe main idea of the program. \n- A user can for half an hour to create a computer game. - The destruction of the foundations of modern industry. \n\n- Destruction of the current relationships: Developer →Publisher → Distributor → Shop →Buyer. \n\n- Creating new relationship: Scenarist → Internet →User.\n\n - The release of creative potential gamers. \n\nDo not add the title of the presentation: What happens in a minute!\nWhite Eyes - this is the beginning. Now I am writing another scenario similar to the program. I will not disclose their Aces to shoot me or losers. We are on the verge of extinction is too heavy and still. The main value will be the scripts, rather than the directors and programmers. Script can itself create movies on your scenario and without the greedy and cunning directors and producers as well game designer will be able to create their own game without the team of programmers, and greedy directors. And distributed movies and games will be on the Internet (free of charge or for a fee). Everything must be simply and relaxed. Everything must be broken up to release. Internet has evolved into a single online game where the user will be able to create your avatar. Sites become virtual buildings, temples and cities. Children and students will be trained in virtual schools. Each user will have their avatars. I wrote the script for the film and realized that it is better to understand the meaning of the script, I just. And I realized that I must do something. I realized that the future for writers, artists, and for some programmers. Just imagine a world where there will be companies producing games and movies. The future will belong to the company created the program. Soon not even be a place for programmers, because they take place robots. Robots will be programmed other robots. Soon there is no place to writers, because the books will write robots. Now we are on the verge of post human when all of the most daring dreams fulfilled. \n\nWatch my blog: http://symbol-sun.blogspot.com/ \nWrite to baskadam@gmail.com \n\nAll rights to &quot;White Eyes&quot; belongs to me. And I live in the countries signed &quot;the Universal Copyright Convention.&quot; Do not deceive me. I am not a fool.\n\n Music: Tanita Tikaram - twist in my sobriety.
