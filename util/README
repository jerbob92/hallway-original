This is a very simple Python script that you can use to build a
tarball that contains everything a locker needs to run, with the
dependencies built with as few dynamically-loaded dependencies as
possible.

It presumes that you already have a complete build environment,
including:

 - Python 2.6+
 - g++ (with libstdc++)
 - libssl
 - a recent version of npm.

Basically, if you've built a full version of the project using
lockerbox.sh or the like, your environment should be in good enough
shape to build the tarball. It fetches its dependencies as necessary,
and takes 10-15 minutes to build.

NOTE: This script can be run from pretty much anywhere, but it needs
the 'run' script to be in the same directory, as it copies it into the
staged tarball directory as part of the build process.
